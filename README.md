# Problem Statement-
Prediction of Yield Production using Machine Learning Techniques and Plant disease detection using Convolutional Neural Network

# About
The methodology for yield prediction involves leveraging machine learning (ML) algorithms and crop simulation models to estimate crop yield based on inputs such as crop state, crop season, crop type, and area of farmland. The test size of the data is set at 0.33, indicating the proportion of the dataset that will be used for testing the predictive models. 
The use of remote sensing data, historical weather information, and field-specific data during the growing season has been emphasized to enhance the accuracy of yield predictions

# How to run-
1. Run the main ipynb file to get the pickle models on the same directory
2. Run the streamlit file using the command- streamlit run stream_project.py
3. Open the localhost to see the frontend
